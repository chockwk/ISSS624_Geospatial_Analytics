# **A Geospatial Analysis of Bus Stop Passenger Volume in Urban Environments**

# 1.1 Overview

In the intricate mosaic of urban transportation, bus stops serve as pivotal nodes that capture the pulse of city life through the ebb and flow of passenger trips. The study of passenger trip traffic, particularly during peak hours, becomes essential for enhancing service efficiency, planning urban infrastructure, and improving the overall commuter experience. This geospatial analysis is anchored in the bustling landscape of a metropolitan area, where data on bus stops, resident population distribution, urban development plans (master plan sub-zones), and passenger volume intertwine to paint a comprehensive picture of transit dynamics.

This analysis aims to dissect the rhythms of urban mobility with the following objectives:

1.  **Geovisualization and Analysis**

    -   Compute the passenger trips generated by origin at the hexagon level
    -   Visualize the geographical distribution of the passenger trips

2.  **Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis**

    -   Compute LISA of the passengers trips generate by origin at hexagon level
    -   Visualize the LISA maps of the passengers trips generate by origin at hexagon level

3.  **Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA)**

    -   Perform Mann-Kendall Test by using the spatio-temporal local Gi\* values
    -   Visualize EHSA maps of the Gi\* values of the passenger trips by origin at the hexagon level

# 1.2 Load packages

`sf` imports geospatial data and `readr` imports csv file.

`tidyverse` performs data import, wrangling and visualization. `dplyr` perform relational join.

`spdep` compute spatial weights and calculate spatially lagged variables.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, readr, dplyr, ggplot2, knitr, mapview, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)
```

# 1.3 Import data

We will be using the following geospatial (`busstops`,  `mpsz`) and aspatial (`odbus`, `pop`) datasets:

::: panel-tabset
## Bus Stops
`busstops` contains the detailed information for all bus stops currently serviced by buses, including bus stop code, road name, description, location coordinates.

Source: LTA DataMall ([Postman URL](http://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/BusStops))

```{r}
busstops <- st_read(dsn = "data/BusStopLocation_Jul2023", layer = "BusStop") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```
The output indicates that the geospatial objects are **point** features. There are **5161 features** and 3 fields. It is in **SVY21** projected coordinates system with **XY** dimension.

## Passenger Volume
`odbus` contains the number of trips by weekdays and weekends from origin to destination bus stops. It reflects the passenger trip traffic for **October 2023**.

Source: LTA DataMall ([Postman URL](http://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/PV/ODBus))

```{r}
odbus = read_csv("data/origin_destination_bus_202310.csv")
```
The output does not indicate any geospatial objects. There are **5,694,297 records** and 7 fields.

## Population
`pop` contains Singapore residents grouped by planning Area or subzone, age group, sex and floor area of residence. The data period is from **June 2011 onwards**. From June 2011 to 2019, the planning areas refer to areas demarcated in the Master Plan 2014, and from June 2020 onwards will be Master Plan 2019.

| x    | Description          |
|------|----------------------|
| PA   | Planning area        |
| SZ   | Subzone              |
| AG   | Age group            |
| Sex  | Sex                  |
| FA   | Residence floor area |
| Pop  | Resident count       |
| Time | Time/period          |

Source: Department of Statistics ([Link](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/find_data/population/statistical_tables/respopagesexfa2011to2020.ashx))

```{r}
pop <- read_csv("data/respopagesexfa2011to2020/respopagesexfa2011to2020.csv")
```

## Subzone
`mpsz` is the Master Plan 2019, a forward looking guiding plan for Singapore's development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years published in **2019**. Note this `mpsz` differs from that in previous chapter, [Data Wrangling](https://cosmic-kitten.netlify.app/hands_on_ex/hands_on_ex01/hands_on_ex01).

Source: URA (Download [here](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/1749/view))

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn="data/MPSZ-2019", layer="MPSZ-2019") %>% 
  st_transform(crs=3414)
```
The output indicates that the geospatial objects are **multipolygon** features. There are **332 features** and 6 fields. It is in **WGS84** projected coordinates system with **XY** dimension.

```{r}
# Assuming mpsz is your sf object
#mpsz <- st_read(dsn="data/MP19_SUBZONE", layer="MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA")

# Ensure that 'geometry' is the active geometry column
#mpsz <- st_set_geometry(mpsz, "geometry")

# Check for invalid geometries and apply st_make_valid if needed
#mpsz$geometry_is_valid <- st_is_valid(mpsz$geometry)
#mpsz <- mpsz %>%
#  mutate(geometry = ifelse(!geometry_is_valid, st_make_valid(geometry), geometry))

# Now, remove the Z dimension explicitly if it exists
#mpsz <- st_zm(mpsz, drop = TRUE, what = "Z")

# View the data structure to confirm changes
#print(mpsz1)
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Warning"}
Warning: GDAL Message 1: Sub-geometry 0 has coordinate dimension 2, but container has 3
:::

The warning message indicate that a discrepancy in the dimensionality of the geometries in `mpsz` Shapefile. Some of the sub-geometries have 2D coordinates (X and Y), while the overall container expects 3D coordinates (X, Y, and Z). The `st_zm(what = "Z")` function drops the Z dimension from the geometries, which eliminate the warnings about coordinate dimensions. We are not performing 3D analysis, this approach should work fine for most applications.

# 1.4 Create Spatial Grids

Spatial grids are commonly used in spatial analysis to divide the study area into equal size, regular polygons that tessellate the area of interest. On the selection of grid, regular geographic units, such as square grid or fishnets, rarely reflect real world situations. Hexagons are compact shape and can overcome oddly-shaped geographical units.

**Step 1: Create a hexgonal grid**

`hexagon` is a hexagon layer of 250m where the distance is the perpendicular distance between the centre of the hexagon and its edges. It is a substitute for 'mpsz' which is relatively coarse and irregular.

::: Panel-tabset
## Step 1
```{r}
# Create hexagonal grid (250m from center to edges) and add grid ID.
area_hexagon_grid = st_make_grid(busstops, cellsize = 500, what = "polygons", square = FALSE)

hexagon_grid_sf = st_sf(area_hexagon_grid) %>% 
  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(area_hexagon_grid)))
hexagon_grid_sf
```
The output indicates that the geospatial objects are **polygon** features. There are **5580 features** and 1 fields. It is in **SVY21** projected coordinates system with **XY** dimension.

## Step 2
```{r}
# Count the number of bus stops in each grid and remove grids without any value.
hexagon_grid_sf$grid_id = lengths(st_intersects(hexagon_grid_sf, busstops))
hexagon_count = filter(hexagon_grid_sf, grid_id > 0)
hexagon_count
```
The output indicates that the geospatial objects retained **polygon** features and there are more than one polygon feature in a grid_id. The intersection of `busstops` and `hexagon_grid_sf` is **1524 features** and 1 fields, indicating only 1524 out of 5580 features contains bus stops. It is in **SVY21** projected coordinates system with **XY** dimension.

## Step 3
```{r}
# Set tmap to view mode for interactive plotting.
tmap_mode("view")
hexagon = tm_shape(hexagon_count)+
  tm_fill(
    col = "grid_id",
    palette = "Reds",
    style = "cont",
    title = "Number of Bus Stops in Singapore",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.6,
    popup.format = list(
      grid_id = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  )+
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)
hexagon
```
The geospatial distribution of bus stops in Singapore, as visualized in the above map, is extensive and dispersed throughout the central region, with a notable concentration of stops with darker shades of red signifying higher concentrations. Outlying regions, along the coastal areas, show fewer bus stops as indicated by the presence of lighter-colored hexagons or even white spaces where no stops are present. This distribution pattern suggests a robust public transportation infrastructure in urban and densely populated areas, tapering off in less populated or industrial regions.

# 1.5 Explore data

`st_geometry()` displays basic information of the feature class, such as type of geometry, the geographic extent of the features and the coordinate system of the data. `glimpse()` transposes the columns in a dataset and makes it possible to see the column name, data type and values in every column in a data frame.

# 1.5 Plot data

`mapview` creates interactive visualisations of spatial data to examine and visually investigate both aspects of spatial data, the geometries and their attributes.

`plot()` takes parameters for specifying points in the diagram. At its simplest, it can plot two numbers against each other. With datasets, it can generate maps and plot the specified columns/attributes, with default up to nine plots or maximum all plots.
