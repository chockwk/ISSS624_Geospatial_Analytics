# 1.1 Overview

# 1.2 Load packages

`sf` `dplyr` `mapview` `tmap`

```{r}
pacman::p_load(knitr, mapview, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, sf)
```

# 1.3 Import data

::: panel-tabset
## Bus Stops

`busstops` contains the detailed information for all bus stops currently being serviced by buses, including bus stop code, road name, description, location coordinates. Source: LTA DataMall ([Postman URL](http://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/BusStops))

```{r}
busstops <- st_read(dsn = "data/BusStopLocation_Jul2023", layer = "BusStop") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

The output indicates that the geospatial objects are **point** features. There are **5161 features** and 3 fields. It is in **SVY21** projected coordinates system with **XY** dimension.

## Passenger Volume

`odbus` contains the number of trips by weekdays and weekends from origin to destination bus stops. It indicates passenger volume for **October 2023**. Source: LTA DataMall ([Postman URL](http://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/PV/ODBus))

```{r}
odbus = read_csv("data/origin_destination_bus_202310.csv")
```

The output does not indicate any geospatial objects. There are **5,694,297 records** and 7 fields.

Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary

The Master Plan is a forward looking guiding plan for Singapore's development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years published in **2019**. Note this `mpsz` differs from that in previous chapter, [Data Wrangling](https://cosmic-kitten.netlify.app/hands_on_ex/hands_on_ex01/hands_on_ex01).

`hexagon` is a hexagon layer of 250m (this distance is the perpendicular distance between the centre of the hexagon and its edges.) should be used to replace the relative coarse and irregular Master Plan 2019 Planning Sub-zone GIS data set of URA.

::: {.callout-tip title="New Package"}
Using `st_read()` to import the new file returns an error: 'Error in CPL_get_z\_range(obj, 3) : z error - expecting three columns' `sf` expects a 3D geometry (X, Y, Z coordinates) but the file being read only contains 2D geometries (X and Y coordinates).

To resolve, we use `geojsonsf` to convert GeoJSON and simple feature objects.

## Hexagon

Spatial grids are commonly used in spatial analysis to divide the study area into equal size, regular polygons that tessellate the area of interest. On the selection of grid, regular geographic units, such as square grid or fishnets, rarely reflect real world situations. Hexagons are compact shape and can overcome oddly-shaped geographical units.

Step 1: Create a hexgonal grid

```{r}
# Create hexagonal grid (250m from center to edges)
area_hexagon_grid = st_make_grid(busstops, cellsize = 500, what = "polygons", square = FALSE)
area_hexagon_grid
```

Step 2: Add Grid ID

```{r}
hexagon_grid_sf = st_sf(area_hexagon_grid) %>% 
  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(area_hexagon_grid)))
hexagon_grid_sf
```

Step 3: Count the number of bus stops in each grid and remove grids without any value.

```{r}
hexagon_grid_sf$grid_id = lengths(st_intersects(hexagon_grid_sf, busstops))
hexagon_count = filter(hexagon_grid_sf, grid_id>0)
```

Step 4: Set tmap to view mode for interactive plotting.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
hexagon = tm_shape(hexagon_count)+
  tm_fill(
    col = "grid_id",
    palette = "Reds",
    style = "cont",
    title = "Number of Bus Stops",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.6,
    popup.format = list(
      grid_id = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  )+
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)
hexagon

  tm_fill(
    col = "grid_id",
    palette = "Reds",
